## API 
An API has been provided inside the project that you can use to query the data to display from.    
The API endpoint to get the swimlane and channel data is `http://localhost:3100/api/swimlanes`.  

### Running the API
In a separate command line terminal run the following commands: 

cd api
npm install
npm start
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3100`
