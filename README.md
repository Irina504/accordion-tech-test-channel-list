# Accordion Technical test
Create a simple app which will display a list of music channels and make them sortable. 


## API 
An API has been provided inside the project that you can use to query the data to display from.    
The API endpoint to get the swimlane and channel data is `http://localhost:3001/api/swimlanes`.  

Instructions on how to run the API can be found in the Getting Started section below. 


## Getting Started
### Running the API
In a separate command line terminal run the following commands: 
```Shell
